Machine learning is a field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves various techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. 
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. These networks automatically learn to extract meaningful patterns from large datasets, making them particularly effective for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech recognition.
